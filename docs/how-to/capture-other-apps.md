# Capture WordPress, Drupal, and other apps

Point the tool at any web app by choosing a preset in the config. Everything after capture (Figma,
alt text, swaps, and verification) is the same for every app.

## Choose a preset

| Preset              | For                                                       | Sign-in                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p1-editor`         | The P1 editor (the default when a config names no preset) | You, in the dedicated Chrome                                    |
| `wordpress-admin`   | wp-admin, the block editor, the Site Editor               | Login form, `WP_USER` and `WP_PASSWORD` from your shell         |
| `drupal-admin`      | Drupal administration pages (Claro)                       | Login form, `DRUPAL_USER` and `DRUPAL_PASSWORD` from your shell |
| `content-publisher` | Pantheon Content Publisher's dashboard                    | You, in the dedicated Chrome                                    |
| `public-site`       | Any public website                                        | None                                                            |

Each preset has a starter brief in `briefs/<preset>.json` and an example config in
`examples/<preset>.config.example.json`. What each preset checks and hides: [Presets](../reference/presets.html).

## WordPress admin

1. Start a local site. [WordPress Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/) runs WordPress on PHP
   directly, with no Docker:

   ```bash
   studio site create --name docs-shots --path ~/Studio/docs-shots
   ```

   Studio shows the admin username and password. Its MCP tool returns the password base64-encoded: decode
   it before you sign in.

2. Write a config:

   ```json
   {
     "topic": "wp-docs",
     "preset": "wordpress-admin",
     "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8881"
   }
   ```

3. Put the sign-in in your shell for this session only. `read -s` keeps the password off the screen and
   out of your shell history:

   ```bash
   export WP_USER=admin
   read -s WP_PASSWORD && export WP_PASSWORD
   ```

4. Check, then capture:

   ```bash
   node scripts/preflight.mjs --config wp.config.json --brief briefs/wordpress-admin.json
   node scripts/capture.mjs --config wp.config.json --brief briefs/wordpress-admin.json --out-dir <out>/wp
   ```

   ```text
   Authenticating...
     dashboard                                     OK
     plugins                                       OK
     block-editor                                  OK
     site-editor                                   OK
     front-page                                    OK

   Done: 5/5 captured, 0 failed, 0 with HTTP >= 400
   ```

   <div class="shot-pair" markdown="1">

   {% include figure.html src="preset-wp-dashboard.jpg" alt="The WordPress dashboard with the admin menu, the Welcome panel, and the Site Health, At a Glance, and Quick Draft widgets." caption="dashboard: admin notices and update counts hidden." %}

   {% include figure.html src="preset-wp-block-editor.jpg" alt="The WordPress block editor on a new post, with the Post settings sidebar open and no welcome guide." caption="block-editor: the welcome guide is hidden, not dismissed." %}

   </div>

For a production site with single sign-on or two-factor authentication, add `"signIn": "chrome"` and the
`chrome` settings, and sign in yourself in the dedicated Chrome, as for P1.

## Drupal admin

1. Start a local site. With PHP 8.3 or later and Composer, Drupal runs on SQLite and PHP's built-in server,
   with no containers (about 160 MB):

   ```bash
   composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-docs
   cd drupal-docs
   vendor/bin/dr install standard --site-name="Docs screenshots"
   cd web && php -S 127.0.0.1:8890 .ht.router.php
   ```

   `dr install` prints the admin password once. Drupal 11.4 replaced `core/scripts/drupal` with `dr`.

2. Write a config with `"preset": "drupal-admin"` and `"baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8890"`, export
   `DRUPAL_USER` and `DRUPAL_PASSWORD` the same way, and capture with `briefs/drupal-admin.json`.

   <div class="shot-pair" markdown="1">

   {% include figure.html src="preset-drupal-content.jpg" alt="The Drupal Content administration page with the Navigation sidebar and an empty content list." caption="content" %}

   {% include figure.html src="preset-drupal-status.jpg" alt="The Drupal Status report showing Drupal 11.4.8, PHP 8.5.10, and SQLite." caption="status-report" %}

   </div>

## Content Publisher

1. Copy `examples/content-publisher.config.example.json`. Set `params.collectionId` to a collection's ID,
   from its URL, for the collection shot.
2. Start the dedicated Chrome with `node scripts/chrome.mjs --config <file>` and sign in with Google.
3. Capture with `briefs/content-publisher.json`.

The starter brief covers Overview, Collections, Sites, and one collection. It leaves out Accounts and Tokens,
which show account data. A trial account shows a free-trial banner across the top; the preset leaves it in.

## Public websites

Use `"preset": "public-site"`. To build a brief from a sitemap instead of the starter brief:

```bash
node scripts/routes.mjs --topic my-site --site https://example.com --sitemap
```

A site behind a bot challenge fails closed: no PNG is saved.

## Add your own app

Copy the closest preset in `scripts/presets/`, change its sign-in, CSS, and actions, and point a brief's
`presets` at it. [Presets](../reference/presets.html#write-a-preset) lists every field.

Next: [Push a run to Figma](push-to-figma.html).
